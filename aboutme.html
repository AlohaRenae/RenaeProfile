    <header>about me</header>

    <main>
        <h3> My journey into the tech industry is unique! I became a mom at a very young age and never really had the
            chance to fully explore a way to combine my passions and a career. As my kids have gotten older my family
            has been very supportive of giving me that chance. I have always had an interest in technology
            and believe the possibilies are endless with what we can do with it. I hoped I could help shape that future!
            Destiny called when I learned about MotherCoders! I was picked along with 14 other women in Utah to
            participate in
            Lehi, UT. It was a great way to learn some coding, networking, about the different careers available, and
            even
            build my own website.
            We have now finished our program and I can't wait to share my passions and a diverse point of view to the
            industry!</h3>

        <p> I live with my husband and 3 kids in SLC, UT. You can catch me with my laptop, camera, or a book. I love
            writing, crafting, and going on adventures
            with my family!</p>
